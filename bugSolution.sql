The solution is to ensure that the value being added to the 'salary' column is explicitly cast or converted to the correct numeric data type before performing the addition.

```sql
UPDATE employees
SET salary = salary + CAST('1000' AS UNSIGNED) -- Or appropriate numeric type
WHERE department = 'Sales';
```

Alternatively, use a numeric literal instead of a string literal:

```sql
UPDATE employees
SET salary = salary + 1000
WHERE department = 'Sales';
```

This corrected version avoids implicit type conversion and guarantees that arithmetic addition is performed, leading to the correct salary updates. The choice between `CAST` and a numeric literal depends on whether the value to be added is dynamically generated and requires type conversion.  It's best practice to avoid string literals for numerical operations in SQL.  Also, ensure that your database design correctly uses numeric data types for salary columns.
